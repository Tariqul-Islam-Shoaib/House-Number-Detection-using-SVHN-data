Project: An Efficient Deep Learning Framework for the Recognition of House Numbers in Street View Imagery.


In the expansive realm of computer vision, the
accurate identification of house numbers within the intricate
tapestry of street view images emerges as a paramount pursuit,
resonating across a panorama of applications. This scholarly
endeavor unfurls an intricately designed deep learning framework, meticulously tailored to navigate the nuances of this task.
Through a calculated amalgamation of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), our proposition fortifies itself against
the headwinds of challenges like capricious lighting conditions,
obfuscating impediments, and the kaleidoscope of idiosyncratic
numerical styles that ensconce these numerals.The architectural
blueprint of our framework is orchestrated with a symphony
of orchestrated phases: the prelude of data preprocessing, the
crescendo of judicious feature extraction, and the denouement of
illuminating sequential learning. With finesse akin to a maestro
wielding a baton, the CNN conducts an intricate symphony of
feature extraction from the visual canvas of images, the RNN
attuned to harmonize with the complex patterns interwoven in the
numeric sequences, and the MLP assuming the mantle of the final
arbiter, clasping the baton to conduct the decisive classification.
